# PeachySnap/TripleSnap
PeachySnap is an automatic game of chance. Players take turns playing the top card of their deck onto the table.
Playing a card that numerically matches a card already on the table rewards you with all the cards from that match onwards.

TripleSnap is similar, but the players have a hand, and select a card to play from their hand.
